# Vanilla JS To-Do App with Cloud Build
A clean, structured To-Do application built with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project uses Capacitor to wrap the standard web code into native Android and iOS applications. It comes pre-configured with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions & Jenkins) to automatically generate Android APKs without needing Android Studio installed locally.

## Features

- **Zero Frameworks:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS for maximum performance.
- **Native Wrapper:** Uses Capacitor to convert the web app to a mobile app.
- **Cloud Building:**
    - **GitHub Actions:** Automatically builds an APK on every push to main.
- **Structured Codebase:** Clean separation of concerns (www/css, www/js, www/index.html).
